# Timeless_Digital_Clock

This program creates a heartbeat-inspired digital clock that displays the current time using animated heart shapes using Java codes written with PROCESSING IDE. The clock consists of:

A dynamic central heart that represents the current hour, growing and shrinking in sync with time.
A ring of minute hearts that expands and contracts based on the current minute.
A second-hand circle of blue hearts that updates dynamically every second.
A digital time display in bold black font, ensuring easy readability.
A custom background image, making the clock visually appealing.
User interaction: Clicking the canvas toggles between heartbeat animation and static display.

This clock presents time in a non-traditional way by using heartbeats as a metaphor for timeâ€™s passage. The program is structured using object-oriented programming (OOP) with a HeartClock class to manage the animations and display logic.
